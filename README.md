Weather App Exam

For my front end, I utilize Vue JS, which is excellent for creating single-page applications. It also offers a data binding capability that will make it simpler for me to build SPA, which is another reason I used it. I can use animation in my project thanks to it as well. It also included a useful Event Handling feature that aids in the creation of dynamic and interactive web pages.

I use the Laravel framework for my backend since it contains a lot of pre-built functions and structures, which allows me to develop more quickly. The MVCS Architecture, which separates the logic, data-handling, UI, and controller processes of the project, also enables me to use it. For cleaner andÂ more understandable code, I use GuzzleHttp instead of cURL for making HTTP requests for weather and location. I also utilize the service layer to separate the business logic from the controller layer, which also enables me to reuse the function incase we need if the project will continue.
